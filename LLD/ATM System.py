# Question â€“ Part 1: Basic ATM Cash Withdrawal
# Design a simplified ATM Machine to handle basic cash withdrawal.
#
# Your system should:
# - Represent cash in different denominations (e.g. 100, 500, 2000).
# - Allow loading the ATM with a certain number of notes of each denomination.
# - Allow users to withdraw cash (e.g. withdraw(1300)) if the ATM has the correct denominations.
#
# Constraints:
# - Dispense highest denominations first (greedy approach).
# - If exact amount cannot be dispensed, the withdrawal should fail.
# - Track remaining cash in the ATM.
#
# Think about:
# - How to represent denominations.
# - A clean class structure that can be extended in future (e.g., logging, user accounts).
# - Where logic for dispensing should reside.
